## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a pretty simple project but good practice to re-enforce my knowledge of flex and mobile design.

### Continued development

I am going to start developing projects using a framework such as Next.js rather than just HTML and CSS
